Note: you can not use WebUpdate app previously included with the older i&gt;clicker 6 software package to update to i&gt;clicker 7 software, please download the new package from the link provided in step 3.</li></ol><h3>A note on REEF, the New Mobile Polling Option from i&gt;clicker</h3><p>i&gt;clicker 7 is integrated with REEF, a mobile polling app that eliminates the need for the handheld i&gt;clicker 2 student remotes and allows polling via mobile devices. REEF also allows live polling in remote locations (for example you can run a poll in Amherst and Springfield at the same time).</p><p>Due to the limitations of the wireless network on UMass Amherst campus, currently mobile polling can only be used in a handful of academic buildings (such as the new Integrative Learning Center (ILC) classrooms, for example).</p><h3 id='i-clicker-download-for-mac-windows-10'>I-clicker Download For Mac Windows 10</h3><p>If you teach in one of the newer classrooms and if you’re interested in REEF, please contact the Instructional Media Lab (instruct@umass.edu   413-545-2823), and we will check if REEF can run on the wireless in your classroom.</p></div></div></div><div class="secondary-nav-bar"><div class="clear-items-navigation"><div class="clear-items-navigation-inner-block">&lArr; &lArr; <a href="/ghl-control-center-download-mac.html">Ghl Control Center Download Mac</a></div></div><div class="secondary-nav-bar">&rArr; &rArr; <a href="/download-pages-09-for-mac.html">Download Pages 09 For Mac</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="aside-page-single layout-single-sm extra-content-row entry-fix-aside singular-layout-aside"><div class="item-static-page layer-label-primary"><div class="item-fn-static"><aside id="layout-clear-row" class="page-article-single container-primary-fn md-item-label md-panel-layer"><div class="layout-clear-row-inner-block"><div class="layout-clear-row-inner-block-item"><form role="search" method="get" class="node-sm-singular" action="#"><label><span class="item-fn-page">Search for:</span><input type="search" class="aside-secondary-block" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s"></label><input type="submit" class="clear-area-post" value="Search"></form></div></div></aside><aside id="col-page-lg"><div class="row-area-primary"><div class="entry-area-fn body-block-item">Recent Posts</div></div><ul><li><a href='/mac-wont-download-updates.html'>Mac Won't Download Updates</a></li><li><a href='/mac-el-capitan-mongodb-download.html'>Mac El Capitan Mongodb Download</a></li><li><a href='/how-to-download-mac-airmail.html'>How To Download Mac Airmail</a></li><li><a href='/instagram-mac-os-x-download.html'>Instagram Mac Os X Download</a></li><li><a href='/norton-internet-security-mac-download.html'>Norton Internet Security Mac Download</a></li><li><a href='/avl-download-free-for-mac.html'>Avl Download Free For Mac</a></li><li><a href='/chaos-on-deponia-mac-download.html'>Chaos On Deponia Mac Download</a></li><li><a href='/download-winzip-mac-106.html'>Download Winzip Mac 10.6</a></li></ul></aside></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="footer-inner-block"><div class="node-box-col clear bold"><div class="node-box-col-inner-block"><div class="node-box-col-inner-block-item"><div class="static-area-row"><div class="item-fn-static"><div class="panel-row-single"><div class="item-fn-static"><div class="article-fn-fix main-new-layer clear solid items-secondary-navigation list-default-md"><div class="list-main-box"></div></div><div class="article-fn-fix md-page-layout singular-panel-container main-new-layer">&copy;&nbsp;2020&nbsp;pagriahari1977.github.io                       </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></footer><a href="#" class="primary-area-entry"><i class="content-box-row box-layout"></i></a></body></html>
