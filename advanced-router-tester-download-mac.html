(Mac only)</strong><br>When measuring against the default router, only very little data can be transferred to measure the network throughput. For fast network connections (e.g. wired connections) this results in very inaccurate measurements. For a WiFi network, it can still help to find a better spot for your device or router. Whenever possible, use two machines to do an exact measurement!</p><h3 id='advanced-router-tester-download-mac-download'>Advanced Router Tester Download Mac Download</h3><p><strong>My results are way lower than expected / printed on box of router</strong><br>It is normal, that the actual network performance on a WiFi network is way lower than advertised. The pratical performance is probably 50-60% of the advertised one. Even then, you need to stand in front of your WiFi router to get to the maximum data rate. You can experiment with the placement of your device and router to improve the data rate. Sometimes all it takes is moving your router 10cm or rotating it 90 degrees.</p><p><strong>What network port is used for the measuring?</strong><br>Network Speed Tester uses a TCP connection over port 4138 to measure the performance. If you measure via firewall/NAT, make sure this port gets passed through.</p><p><strong>Connections are dropped</strong><br>When you have multiple WiFi routers, or routers with more than one frequency band, the test can stop, when a router/frequency change occurs. Just start the test again.</p><h3 id='advanced-router-tester-download-mac-software'>Advanced Router Tester Download Mac Software</h3><p><strong>The server doesn’t show up even though it is running</strong><br>Servers are found via Apple’s Bonjour technique. This usually only works on local networks, not when there is a router in between. In these cases, note the address of the server (found in status on the bottom of the window) and add this address manually on the client you are testing from.</p><p><strong>What is my current WiFi connection speed?</strong><br>On the Mac, Option-Click on the Wifi menu.
