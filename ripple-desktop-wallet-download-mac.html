Ledger Nano X [Recommended Ripple Wallet]</span></h3><p>Want a hardware wallet to store your Ripple coins for the long term and the flexibility to access them on mobile?</p><p>Try Ledger Nano X by Ledger SAS- a France based company expert in making security solutions for digital assets like Ripple.</p><p>It is a multi-currency HD wallet that supports more than 1000 cryptocurrencies and tokens including Ripple coin. So if you are a holder of XRP coin this is the best XRP coin wallet you can get right now.</p><p>Ledger Nano X is Bluetooth enabled with a battery that’s why it is easily usable with iOS and Android devices without any OTG or USB.</p><div><strong>PS: </strong>Always buy Ledger Nano X from this official website, purchases made through other sources such as Amazon have been reported faulty resulting in compromising of user’s funds.</div><p>Plus you get the Ledger Live app to control and manage your funds on the desktop but you need not worry as your private keys are always on the device.</p><p>Lastly, the device looks very stylish with an improved design and UI as compared with Ledger Nano S, which is the precursor of the Nano X device.</p><h3><span>#2. Ledger Nano S (Hardware Wallet)</span></h3><p>Developed by a France based start-up, Ledger Nano S is one of the world’s most popular hardware wallet to safely store your cryptocurrencies.</p><p>It is a small flash drive like device that comes with an OLED screen which helps in transaction authorization on the device and it is an HD wallet.</p><div><strong>PS: </strong>Always buy Ledger Nano S from this official website, purchases made through other sources such as Amazon have been reported faulty resulting in compromising of user’s funds.</div><p>When you setup Ledger Nano for the first time you will get your 12 to 24-words long seed which is very important to keep your funds safely.</p><p>If you lose these seed words now one can help you retrieve any of your funds from the Ledger Nano S. So if you have a significant amount of Ripple cryptocurrency, you should no think twice in getting yourself a Ledger Nano S device.</p><p>Ledger Nano S is now available in 6 colors and it will cost you around $100 to safeguard your hundreds of cryptocurrencies on it.</p><h3><span><strong>#3. CoolWallet S</strong>(Hardware Wallet)</span></h3><p>CoolWallet S is also a multi-currency hardware wallet designed specifically for a modern world.</p><p>It is a small credit/debit card like device with a small digital screen on it. You can use this wallet in conjunction with your iOS or Android mobile wallets and still be assured of the security of your funds.</p><p>You can also use this wallet with Bluetooth/WiFi/NFC and can store Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, and ERC20 Tokens on it.</p><p>And like the Ledger Nano S wallet, when you set up your CoolWallet S you will get your 12, 18, 24- words long seed that you need to safeguard always to be in control of your funds.</p><h3><span>#4. Toast Wallet (Mobile &amp; Desktop Wallet)</span></h3><p>Toast wallet is another reliable name that you need to take while talking about XRP wallets.</p><p>Toast wallet provides both mobile and desktop wallets for various types of users to store their Ripple cryptocurrency.</p><p>Also, it a free to use open-source XRP Wallet for iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and Linux. And the developers believe that they have created a cross-platform XRP wallet that’s simple enough for your grandma but safe enough for a Swiss banker.</p><p>Moreover, control your funds here and no secret or private key ever leave out of your device because everything is designed in a non-custodial way.</p><p>Lastly, it is a Ripple-only wallet that shows the developers are razor-focused on developing their product for one cryptocurrency i.e XRP.</p><h3><span>#5. Edge Wallet (Mobile Wallet)</span></h3><p>Looking for something even simpler than Toast wallet?</p><p>Well, we have got your back here.</p><p>Edge wallet is a popular multi-currency wallet that has been here since 2014 and is developed by experienced developers of the Aitbitz wallet.</p><p>Airbitz is another reliable Bitcoin wallet but its successor is Edge wallet with an improved UI and security.</p><p>With Edge, you need not even save your seed as you can just get started by setting up a strong username and password which always remains encrypted on your device.</p><p>Edge crypto wallet currently supports BTC, BCH, LTC, QTUM, DASH, XRP, etc.</p><p><a href='/download-dramatical-murder-free-mac.html'>/download-dramatical-murder-free-mac.html</a>. Dramatical Murder is a visual novel style game and it is one of those games that people either love and think is clever. Or they hate it and think that it is lame. I do feel that for visual novel fans, Dramatical Murder is well worth taking a closer look at as it is a little different from the norm.</p><p>Another recommendation from our end while using the Edge wallet is to use their Biometric TouchID and FaceID login for an enhanced level of security.</p><p>Edge wallet is available for both iOS and Android devices.</p><h3><span>#6. Ethos Wallet (Mobile Wallet)</span></h3><p>Ethos wallet is one of my favorite mobile wallets and if you have multiple currencies then this one of the best wallets to use.</p><p>It is also well known as the world’s most advanced universal wallet to store 100+ cryptocurrencies &amp; ERC20 tokens including Ripple.</p><p>Moreover, with Ethos SmartKey, you get the best security of a non-custodial wallet and its UI is just too good to understand by yourself.</p><p>SmartKeys are a bit different from the private keys but gives you full control of your wallet and is much like the seed.</p><p>And it gets better:</p><p>With Ethos wallet, you can use the WatchFolio feature that helps you keep a watch on many other cryptocurrencies that you have saved elsewhere.</p><p>Lastly, the good thing:</p><p>Ethos wallet is available for both iOS and Android devices.</p><h3><span>#7. Abra Wallet (Mobile Wallet)</span></h3><p>Another free to use Mobile wallet for XRP is Abra wallet.</p><p>Abra wallet is a multi-currency HD wallet where you can store and manage more than 10 cryptocurrencies including Ripple.</p><p>Plus using the Abra app you can invest in 28 cryptocurrencies as they have their inbuilt crypto exchange and still control your funds because it is a non-custodial wallet.</p><p>Being a non-custodial wallet you get access to your unique recovery phrase/seed and thus you always control your funds.</p><p>Abra wallet is available as of now for both iOS and Android devices.</p><h3><span>#8. Exarpy (Web Wallet)</span></h3><p>Exarpy wallet is for those who want another reliable web wallet for XRP.</p><p>It is a non-custodial, fast, and secure way to handle your XRP funds but remember that this is a warm-wallet so you should not hold a significant amount of Ripple in it.</p><p>Another important thing before choosing this wallet:</p><p>Exarpy is not a free wallet and it charges a flat service fee of 0.025 XRP per transaction (for transferring and importing). This fee includes the Ripple network transaction cost.</p><p>Lastly, you can make as many XRP wallets you want because there is no fee for making those wallets. (20 XRP deposit is a must though). Also, this is a pure web version, so you can access your wallet from any browser or any device very easily.</p><h3><span>#9. Cryptonator (Mobile &amp; Web Wallet)</span></h3><p>I know some of you might not like the headache of holding your private keys or seed.</p><p>So for such users, there is Cryptonator wallet</p><h3 id='ripple-desktop-wallet-download-mac-os'>Ripple Desktop Wallet Download Mac Os</h3><p>Cryptonator is free to use hot-wallet or I should rather say non-custodial wallet where you don’t control your keys or seed.</p><p>However, it doesn’t mean that you should just ignore this wallet because there are other 2-FA authentications in place to give you security.</p><h3 id='ripple-desktop-wallet-download-mac-1010'>Ripple Desktop Wallet Download Mac 10.10</h3><p>With Cryptonator you can hold more than 10 cryptocurrencies including Ripple and you can exchange Ripple for other cryptocurrencies in the app itself.</p><p>Cryptonator has an Android app as well as a web version of its platform available for you.</p><h3><span>#10. Wirex (Mobile &amp; Web Wallet)</span></h3><p>Wirex is another custodial wallet solution to hold your XRP coins.</p><p>Using Wirex mobile and web apps one can securely store, receive, and send four cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, XRP).</p><p>But here you don’t control your seed or private keys but you 3-D Secure protection for all online transactions from unauthenticated payments.</p><p>It is also one of the very few UK based crypto-fiance companies regulated by the financial authority of Europe and it gives your crypto-cash-backs also when you spend from their app.</p><p>You also get their iOS and Android mobile apps for using the Wirex platform which is currently available in 5 languages-English, Spanish, French, Japanese and Russian.</p><p>With Wirex you get these wallets:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin Wallet</li><li>Ethereum Wallet</li><li><strong>XRP (Ripple) Wallet </strong></li><li>Litecoin Wallet</li><li>GBP Wallet</li><li>USD Wallet</li><li>EUR Wallet</li></ul><h3><span>#11. Ripple Paper Wallet</span></h3><p>Expert in paper wallets?</p><h3 id='ripple-wallet-address'>Ripple Wallet Address</h3><p>Well, then you can use Ripple paper wallets but paper wallets need a lot more caution from the users’ end because it is just a piece of paper with private keys on it.</p><p>Anyone with this paper wallet can take away your funds instantly but if you keep paper wallets safely, it is a good &amp; cheap way to store your ripple coins.</p><p>But hardware wallets are superior to paper wallets. Of course, hardware wallets come with a cost but they are worth having to enhance your security as they are reliable cold storage for your cryptos.</p><img src='https://i1.wp.com/www.mrvyasidea.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Toast-Best-Ripple-wallet.jpg?resize=840%2C380&ssl=1' alt='Wallet' title='Wallet'><p>So if you are looking for a reliable option then you should not look further than Ledger Nano S but if you still want paper wallets here is the link:</p><h3><span><strong>Over to You</strong></span></h3><p>Ripple has a much-matured infrastructure than other cryptocurrencies and for some unknown reason, it has garnered interest from investors.</p><p>And because of that there are many free and paid Ripple wallets where you can store your Ripple coins.</p><h3 id='cached'>Cached</h3><p>Last but not least I have made this list of Ripple wallets after extensive research of suggested Ripple wallets on Reddit.
