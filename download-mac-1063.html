This was released along with the Mac OS X leopard to get the response from the end-user about its practicality and when all positive reviews turned in, apple decided to go with the MacApp store with a tweak to the software frame and also improving the user interface between the user and the system.</p><h2>Lesser space</h2><img src='https://news-cdn.softpedia.com/images/fitted/340x180/Apple-Posts-New-Mac-OS-X-10-6-4-Update-for-iMac-Mid-2010.jpg' alt='Mac' title='Mac'><p>Apple was very particular about reducing the amount of memory taken up by the operating system. Since the Mac OS X Snow leopard was an overhaul feature improvement update, Apple planned to keep things subtle and succeeded in keeping the bar less than 7GB compared to its ancestor the Mac OS X leopard. They mainly cut down on the space that was used up for pre-installed drivers for printers.</p><h2>User Interface tweaks</h2><p>Apple also made an intelligent watch over the aesthetic details that accompanied with the update. They made sure that they made the user interface as interactive and compelling as possible to give the user a good experience while using the system. they also made sure that the tweak in the traffic light type buttons on the title bar is kept subtle and lighter to give a jump to the aesthetic detailing.</p><p>The finder application was also fully revamped from scratch and was written in Cocoa, Apple’s very own objective-oriented programming language. This gave Apple the chance to upgrade their usage as well as get the most out of cocoa as well.</p><img src='https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/Qyav8PHjTNzRMY1qSiZjqJD55pI=/770x433/2009/08/26/62b3cc20-8d71-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/fl_SnowLeopard09-720-50076186-20090826_133533.jpg' alt='Download Mac 10.6.3' title='Download Mac 10.6.3'><p>The sleep and boot rate of the Mac OS X snow leopard is considered to be the best and fast in its class.</p><h2>Architecture transformation</h2><p>With the Mac OS X Snow leopard, the 32-bit architecture went into the dark in the history of constructing architecture for apple devices. This ensures that apple devices only worked on 64-bit resolutions. This meant that the previous apple device which could only support 32-bit were starting to rot as scrap. This move from Apple wasn’t welcome by many but as the popularity of the 64-bit architecture spread, apple sufficed through the rough patch.</p><h2>Open CL</h2><p>The Open Computing Language or popularly known as the Open CL is considered as the language that paved the way for improvement in the graphical user interface of the Apple devices. The precision involved in numerical processing made by the open CL ensures that the optimal use of the graphical interface was done. This also ensured that the proper load of work was put on the GPU and enabled to adapt the screen to 3-D games like a pro. The open CL is based on the open standard format that was supported by all the leading graphical processing chips of famous brand names like AMD, Intel, Nvidia, etc. <a href='/creative-cloud-manager-download-mac.html' title='Creative cloud manager download mac'>Creative cloud manager download mac</a>.</p><h2>System requirements</h2><ul><li>Mac Computer with intel processor supporting X84-64-bit architecture.</li><li>5GB of free hard disk space.</li><li>1GB minimum RAM.</li><li>DVD drive or external USB drive.</li></ul><h2>Download Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6 ISO and DMG direct file</h2><p>You can download the Mac OS X Snow leopard DMG file directly from the ISO river post absolutely free of cost.
