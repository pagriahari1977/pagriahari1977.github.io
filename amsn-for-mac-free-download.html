In 0.99, which will be released (hopefully) soon, we will implement the new MSNP18 protocol version, which will enable signing in at multiple locations, offline messages, and hopefully audio and video calls too. 0.98.9 is the same as a 0.99 release but without MSNP18 support, this way you get the latest stable release just before we upgrade the protocol.</p><p>Download aMSN now for free, as always, from our website!</p><p>If you have any comments and feedback, feel free to join the forums and leave us your suggestions.</p><p>The aMSN Team!</p><h3>aMSN2's status<br>January 16, 2012 @ 11:43:23</h3><h2>What is aMSN2 ?</h2><p>aMSN2 is a complete rewrite of aMSN in python. It uses the papyon framework to connect toMSN servers. It is meant to be multi-frontend so that it has a native look on theoperating system you use. Available frontends include :</p><ul><li>Cocoa, for MacOSX,</li><li>GTK, should be ran mainly on Linux,</li><li>Qt4, being able to run on both Linux and Windows,</li><li>EFL, the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, should only run on Linux but a Windowsport may come to light someday,</li><li>Curses, to enjoy aMSN2 on your terminals,</li><li>Web, so that you can use aMSN2 from your favorite browser!</li></ul><h2>Is it daily usable?</h2><h3>Short answer</h3><p>No!</p><h3>Long answer</h3><p>The most advanced frontend is the GTK one. It's almost usable.<br>The cocoa frontend needs love.<br>The Qt4 frontend should be almost usable soon.<br>On the Curses frontend, you can only see your contact list, but you won't be able to chat.The web frontend is completely broken. I plan on writing a blog post on why it's brokenand how we may fix it.About the EFL frontend, I'm also an enlightenment developer so I will fix it when I'llhave enough time.</p><h3>but when do you give us a beta version to try it?</h3><p>Each time we get asked, the release is postponed for 3 months, so now I can say it's post2020 ☺ .</p><p>But you can help us!!</p><img src='https://loaditsoft.com/img/screenshots/amsn-1.gif' alt='Amsn for mac free download windows 7' title='Amsn for mac free download windows 7'><h2>How to contribute?</h2><p>The development is hosted on github.

It contains several bugfixes, including the bug which made you unable to read Offline Messages.</p><p>This should be our last bugfix release before 0.99, in which we will enable Audio/Video calls again, as we’ve been working hard on implementing the newest P2P protocol changes.</p><p>Get your copy now, and Happy Holidays!</p><h3>Google Summer of Code Participation<br>April 3, 2010 @ 02:58:55</h3><p>Hello fellow developers and aMSN enthusiasts!</p><p>As some of you might know, this year again, we’d like to participate in the Google Summer of Code program. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get aMSN as an organization, but, just like previous years, we will be generously given a slot by the Tcl/Tk community who is acting once again as an umbrella organization.</p><p>What this means is that you still have until April 10th to submit an application for GSoC, and to do so, you should go the GSoC webapp and fill an application under the organization “Tcl/Tk Community” and submit your proposal for an aMSN related project.</p><p>You can get ideas on what we’d really like people to work on by having a look at our wiki. Don’t forget you can submit your own ideas if you wish to, but make sure it’s something we’d like to see and that it’s worth working on for 2.5 months at 40 hours/week.</p><p>Make sure you read the User Guide and the FAQ that Google has put up and don’t forget that this is just like submitting an application for a job (there is 4500$USD involved.) so you need to make sure you convince us that you are the best person for the job. Quality over quantity, and only submit an application if you know you can do and finish the project on time.</p><p>I hope we can get good students this year who will help us improve aMSN.</p><p>Thanks.</p><h3>Why aMSN 0.98.3 and where is 0.98.2?<br>March 8, 2010 @ 07:07:12</h3><p>Some of you might have noticed that the 0.98.2 version of aMSN was never released. and you might be wondering why!</p><p>The reason is simple, we planned to release aMSN 0.98.2 for so long now, we had multiple opportunities to do it and we even tagged in SVN and released a tarball with the sources of aMSN 0.98.2 <strong>twice</strong> already. but in the end, we never made that release official! One reason is that we always end up finding huge bugs the day after we start releasing it. second reason is that we can’t release without proper windows, mac and linux binaries, and for some reason, we never had the time to create those packages, so we ended up with the source package released, no binary packages, and in the end, it’s too late.</p><p>When we finally got around to doing this new release today, we decided to skip the 0.98.2 version and go directly to 0.98.3 to avoid any confusion, because *<strong>maybe*</strong> someone downloaded the 0.98.2 source package at some point when it was available, maybe some distributions noticed the tag in SVN and started to ship that version. So to avoid having two possible versions of aMSN with the same version number, we released 0.98.3!</p><p>I hope this satisfied everyone’s curiosity… if anyone actually noticed…</p><img src='https://static.macupdate.com/screenshots/261485/m/amsn-screenshot.png?v=1589975418' alt='Amsn For Mac Free Download' title='Amsn For Mac Free Download'><p>Now go grab your aMSN 0.98.3 anow and enjoy! </p><h3>aMSN 0.98.3 released!<br>March 8, 2010 @ 01:04:13</h3><p>Hi all,</p><p>aMSN 0.98.3 has just been released. It contains several bugfixes, the most important one being that nicknames aren’t reset to the one associated with your Passport account when you connect anymore.</p><p>Unfortunately, Audio/Video support was also dropped, as explained in this previous post.</p><p>For Linux users, autopackage support was dropped as well, since the autopackage project seemed to be dead and most distributions already supply aMSN anyway.</p><h2 id='amsn-for-mac-download'>Amsn For Mac Download</h2><p>Fetch your copy of aMSN now, and have fun!</p><h3>New aMSN Blog and new website news system<br>March 6, 2010 @ 07:56:14</h3><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>As some of you will notice, the news on the front page of the aMSN website have slightly changed.</p><p>We decided to do two things. First, we started our very own blog! We will be posting news on that blog, so you can start following it and add it to your favorite RSS reader!</p><p>We’ve also decided to change the old system of posting news on the website, that system was very old and very hard to use, that’s why we weren’t posting a lot of news to it. But hopefully, with this new system, everything will change! We hope to start posting more and more entries to our blogs and keep the community updated on what we do behind the scenes, and by automatically updating the front page of the aMSN website with our blog posts, this will make it easier for everyone to follow.</p><p>We’ve decided to start a Planet, which is a kind of RSS reader, that will read our blog posts from various blogs (we have the aMSN blog at http://amsn-project.net/blog, but some developers might also have their own personal blogs), and it will update the front page automatically for us.</p><p>You can also get an RSS feed directly for the front page of aMSN’s news by adding this RSS to your RSS reader.</p><p>The issues we currently have with this new system is that it’s not translated, but there is a way to make it multilanguage, and we will improve on that soon.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Enjoy!</p><h3>aMSN 0.98.2 to be released without Audio/Video support<br>March 3, 2010 @ 00:24:48</h3><p>Hey,</p><p>Mar 23, 2016.

Obviously, we can’t move to MSNP18 at the moment, because MPOP support isn’t really ready yet, and because MSNP2PV2 hasn’t been implemented, so we had to remove the Audio/Video support in aMSN SVN for now, and only have it available for those who are brave enough to try out MSNP18.</p><p>We will soon release 0.98.2 as it is long overdue now, and we want to let people know why their A/V calls are not available to them anymore.</p><p>I hope everybody will understand why this is happening and we won’t get flooded by n00b questions everyday…</p><h3>aMSN 0.98.1 is released!<br>November 11, 2009 @ 07:35:34</h3><p>Hi everyone!</p><p>It’s been over a year since the release of 0.97.2, and “good things come to those who wait”: audio conference, video conference, chat while appearing offline, full ink (handwriting) support, MSN games support (only tic-tac-toe for now), a new protocol version, and of course, your favorite bugfixes!</p><p>For those of you who happened to discover 0.98 on third-party sites and wonder where it went, this release was tagged and packed but never officially made public. 0.98.1 contains a lot of important fixes so update now!</p><p>We are also proud to announce that the Maemo 5 platform (Nokia’s N900) is now supported.</p><p>Visit our downloads page now!</p><h2 id='msn-for-mac-downloads'>Msn For Mac Downloads</h2><h3>amsn-project.net goes Multilangual<br>November 11, 2009 @ 07:33:45</h3><p>Hello users of the world!</p><p>Thanks to an awesome contribution from one of the aMSN users, we are now able to provide you with a localized version of the website!</p><p>You can now choose to view your favorite website in English, French, Spanish, German or Turkish!
